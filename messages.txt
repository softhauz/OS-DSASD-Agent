Hi! I will be your agent for today. I'm here to help you find out if you have contracted the Covid-19 disease on January 9, 2019 based on the information that I have. I will also be able to tell you about the source of infection and how you contracted Covid-19, if you've been infected. I'm continuously learning, so I might be able to give you better results as you tell me more about the situation. Let's get started. What name would you prefer to be called?

Please tell me about all of the places that you've been to on 9th of January 2019, starting with the very first place you've visited on this day. For example, if you went to the gym and grocery store at Location 1, then, ate at a restaurant at Location 4, you can simply type, 'gym grocery 1 restaurant 4'.
